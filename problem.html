    <h1>The main problem</h1>
    <p>It's been something like two months that I applyed to be an intern
      at a Brazilian investment bank called Bradesco. Since then, I had 3
      interviews. The first one with the HR was about what I wanted to do
      in the bank and why I wanted to work there; the second one was with
      a senior manager and was more to talk about the venture capital part
      of the bank (The one that I had chosen); and the last one, that was
      last Tuesday, was a technical one with a junior manager. At the
      moment the last interview was over I started to get ansious to get
      the result, and I'm ansious until now. The problem is that this
      anxiety makes me do nothing all day every day.</p>
