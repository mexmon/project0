    <h1>My current life situation</h1>

    <p>Since I got to Brazil I am not being very productive. I have a lot of
       free time but I just don't feel like doing stuff. My first week was
       good because I took my time to meet all my family and have a great
       time with them. After the first week the only relevant things that
       I did was to do some internship interviews that I did pretty well
       and two parties that I went that I had lots of fun. Other than that
       I had just read a book about high growth startups.</p>
