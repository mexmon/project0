Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I created a web page with some plans for this summer. almost all of the requirements are in the index.html file. The other 4 .html pages just contain simple texts. Here are some of the requirements that can be seen by only opening the web page:

1. At the beginning of the page I have a title with a background.

2. An image

3. Four other .html pages using hyperlink and unordered lists

4. A table with my possible plans
